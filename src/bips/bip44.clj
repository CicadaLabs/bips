(defn derivation-path
  "The derivation-path multi-arity function. The first version takes
  four arguments: a `coin-type`, an `account` index, a `chain` type,
  and an `address` index.  It uses these values to construct a string
  representing a path to a specific wallet address.  Throws an
  exception with an error message if the `coin-type` in not found in
  `coin_types.edn`.  A second version taking two arguments is used to
  derive an account address from a `coin-type` and an `account`
  index."
